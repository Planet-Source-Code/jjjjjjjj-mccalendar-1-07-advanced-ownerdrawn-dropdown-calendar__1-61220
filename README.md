### Description

**Not an another big stack of controls**. This is an accurately build ownerdrawn, sizable, lightweight (not in code) calendar control with 'Dropdown' , 'List' mode and as beautiful as my girlfriend. The calendar is provided with unique form animation and eight different color-themes. The calendar if fully customisable with wide range of color options. A fresh technique is used to show the dropdown calendar. A help form is also included to understand the functionlity easly. Hope you all like it. Jim Jose ;-))
